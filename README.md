# E-commerce-backend
This application was created to run a successful functionality of an E-commerce platform based on the RESTful CRUD operations (create, read, update and delete) using Sequelize models.

# Description
The user needs to access the database through MySQL with the commands "mysql -u root -p" and enter its password. Next, the user needs to create the database by typing the commands "source schema.sql;" (in my case I typed "source db/schema.sql;" because the terminal path was not in the db folder). After creating the database the user can exit MySQL by typing the command "quit;". After doing that, it is necessary to type "npm run seed" in order to populate the database with the information for all categories, products and tags. Finally, to start the application it is necessary to run the server with the commands "node server.js". A message will display to inform that the application is listening on the port 3001. Insomnia is the software used to test the functionality of this application.

# Usage

# Technologies
